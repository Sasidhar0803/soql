 🔹 Beginner Level

1. Contacts with last name Smith


SELECT Id, LastName 
FROM Contact 
WHERE LastName = 'Smith'


✔️ You had a typo (`slect` → `SELECT`).

2. Accounts created in last 30 days


SELECT Id, Name 
FROM Account 
WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS30


✔️ SOQL uses `=` with date literals (not `` inside).

3. Accounts starting with “A”


SELECT Name, Phone 
FROM Account 
WHERE Name LIKE 'A%'


✔️ `%A` means “ends with A”. If you want “starts with A”, use `A%`.

 🔹 Intermediate Level

4. Opportunities  100,000 and Open


SELECT Id, Name, Amount 
FROM Opportunity 
WHERE Amount  100000 
AND IsClosed = FALSE


✔️ Better to use `IsClosed = FALSE` instead of assuming StageName = 'Open'.

5. Contacts under “Acme Corp”


SELECT Id, LastName 
FROM Contact 
WHERE Account.Name = 'Acme Corp'


✔️ Perfect ✅

6. Accounts with at least one Opportunity


SELECT Id, Name 
FROM Account 
WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity)


✔️ You don’t need `GROUP BY` or `HAVING =1` — `IN` already ensures at least one child exists.

7. Accounts with no Opportunities


SELECT Id, Name 
FROM Account 
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity)


✔️ Correct ✅

8. Top 10 Opportunities by Amount


SELECT Id, Name, Amount 
FROM Opportunity 
ORDER BY Amount DESC 
LIMIT 10


✔️ Add `DESC` so it shows largest first.

 🔹 Advanced Level

9. Top 5 Accounts by total Opportunity Amount


SELECT AccountId, Account.Name, SUM(Amount) totalAmount
FROM Opportunity
GROUP BY AccountId, Account.Name
ORDER BY totalAmount DESC
LIMIT 5


✔️ Needs `SUM(Amount)` for totals. Your version grouped by AccountId but didn’t SUM.

10. Accounts with ≥ 3 Opportunities


SELECT AccountId, Account.Name, COUNT(Id) oppCount
FROM Opportunity
GROUP BY AccountId, Account.Name
HAVING COUNT(Id) = 3


✔️ Must be written on Opportunity, since only child objects can be grouped.

11. Largest Opportunity per Account
👉 SOQL alone can’t return just the largest per group — you can only do this in Apex or using a subquery per Account


SELECT Id, Name,
   (SELECT Id, Name, Amount 
    FROM Opportunities 
    ORDER BY Amount DESC 
    LIMIT 1)
FROM Account


✔️ Your query was invalid because `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY LIMIT` don’t mix this way.

12. Opportunities closed in last 90 days, grouped by Stage


SELECT StageName, COUNT(Id) oppCount
FROM Opportunity
WHERE CloseDate = LAST_N_DAYS90
GROUP BY StageName


✔️ Needs `COUNT(Id)` with `GROUP BY`.

13. Cases with related Contact Name


SELECT Id, CaseNumber, Contact.Name 
FROM Case


✔️ Use `Contact.Name`, not `contact.lastname` only.

14. Accounts with top 2 Opportunities by Amount


SELECT Id, Name,
   (SELECT Id, Name, Amount 
    FROM Opportunities 
    ORDER BY Amount DESC 
    LIMIT 2)
FROM Account


✔️ Fixed typo (`opporunties` → `Opportunities`).
